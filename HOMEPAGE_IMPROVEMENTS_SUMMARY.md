### 2. Featured Agency Priority System ✅

#### Enhanced Sorting Algorithm
The homepage now uses a sophisticated multi-level sorting system:

```
Score Calculation:
- Featured Car: +10,000 points

- Homepage Priority (0-100): +(priority × 100) points
- Average Rating (0-5): +rating points
```

#### Display Order
1. **Featured Cars** (highest priority - 10,000+ points)
2. **Cars from Featured Agencies** (medium-high priority - 5,000+ points)
3. **High Priority Cars** (by admin-set priority)
4. **Regular Cars** (by rating)

**Example Scenarios**:
- Featured car with priority 50 and rating 4.5: **10,000 + 5,004.5 = 15,004.5 points**
- Non-featured car from featured agency with priority 80 and rating 4.8: **5,000 + 8,004.8 = 13,004.8 points**
- Regular car with priority 90 and rating 4.9: **9,004.9 points**

**Benefits**:
